About MyQuickNet:
MyQuickNet is an open-source web application framework using JavaScript
and PHP developed by MyQuickNet Development Group.
It uses jQuery as the JavaScript library, MySQL as the database, PHPUnit for
PHP unit testing, QUnit for JavaScript unit testing, and NetBeans IDE for
development.

Files/directory structure:
html/ --- directory that contains HTML file(s)
jquery/ --- directory that contains jQuery and QUnit related file(s)
js_object/ --- directory that contains JavaScript (object) file(s)
js_test/ --- directory that contains JavaScript test file(s)
php_class/ --- directory that contains PHP class file(s)
php_test/ --- directory that contains PHP test file(s)
public/ --- directory that contains public accessible resource(s)
sql/ --- directory that contains SQL file(s)
sqlite/ --- directory that contains the default sqlite3 database
.htaccess --- file that contains Apache configuration
COPYING -- file that contains the GNU General Public License
README --- the file that you are reading now
config.php --- the basic configuration file for all PHP class files
index.php --- the main PHP file

Notes:
1. You should modify "config.php" to add/change path(s) for PHP class files,
change default timezone settings, etc., and modify "index.php" to use your own
controller.
2. Files "php_class/com/myquicknet/testing/*.class.php",
"php_class/com/myquicknet/testing_config/*.class.php",
"js_object/com/myquicknet/testing/*.js",
"js_object/com/myquicknet/testing_config/*.js" are example configurations/uses.
3. "MQNAutoRecordTest.php" and "MQNAutoRecordQueryTest.php" in directory
"php_test/php_class/com/myquicknet/autorecord/" shows how to use MQNAutoRecord
and MQNAutoRecordQuery as ORM.
4. MQNAutoRecord, MQNAutoRecordQuery and MQNAutoRecordQueryTable instances use
database resource. It is advised to free these instances explicitly (set to
null) as in the above test files.
5. Each database table used for MQNAutoRecord must have two (reserved) fields:
"id" and "valid".
6. It is simple to write Object-Oriented JavaScript program by using
"newType.def()" as in the JavaScript object files. Method "_" should be called
explicitly after using "new" to create and initialize instances. Method (other
than "_") with name started by an underscore should be treated as protected
method. Method with name not started by an underscore should be treated as
public method. The first letter of public method name and the second letter
(the letter just after the underscore) of protected method name should be
small. The first letter of type name should be capital. Use "base" to access
the base type prototype. Use "my" to access the object holding private data
member(s). Use "shared" to access the object holding static data member(s).
7. File "html/default.html" is the default html file.
8. File ".htaccess" controls how Apache rewrites URL. The default URL for the
default html file is "http://localhost/MyQuickNet/".
9. TestingController and TestingView are the controller and view classes for
the URL "http://localhost/MyQuickNet/testing/".
10. Using default settings, "http://localhost/MyQuickNet/xxx/" would use
class "XxxController" as the controller.
11. Please choose "config.php" as the bootstrap file when using PHPUnit.
12. "TestingAutoRecordManagerConfig.class.php" uses SQLite as the default
database for testing. Please modify it to choose between MySQLi and SQLite. You
should also import data from the SQL file(s) into the database before testing
if a new database is used.

Major changes from version 2.0.1:
* fixed a bug related to MQNAutoRecordQuery.

Major changes from version 1.0.0:
* MyQuickNet uses PHP 5.3+.
* All PHP and JavaScript files in paths like ".../com/myquicknet/..." moves to
".../com/googlecode/myquicknet/...".
* All PHP files, except "config.php" and "index.php", have no include() or
require() statements.
* "config.php" defines MyQuickNet base path constant "MQN_BASE_PATH".
* All JavaScript files (jQuery and QUnit not checked), have 'use strict'
statements.
* MyQuickNet supports SQLite ("MQNDatabaseSQlite.class.php").
